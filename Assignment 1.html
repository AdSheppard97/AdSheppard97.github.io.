            This is a site hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> using html elements and github repositories.

        <h2>The github workflow</h2>
        <p>
            To begin with a git commit is like saving a change to a document or project but it records who made the change and what has changed inside.
        </p>
        <p>
            A git branch is like copying and pasting a project for you to work on without actually making any changes to the repository and is a safe way to change code.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally a git pull request is like a review before you commit to the main repository
        </p>
<h3>The Unix Shell</h3>
<p>
    The Unix Shell or bash is a very powerful tool used for file management outside of your standard OS file management system
    The tool primarily uses commands similar to a command prompt<i>cmd</i> including but not limited to <i>ls</i> which lists all of your files in the targeted directory
    <i>pwd</i>> which shows you the current directory you are viewing/editing additionally you can use <i>cd or cd dir</i> which changes your targeted directory.
    In my opinion the most useful tool in gitbash is the ability to create folder or files very quickly using <i>mkdir insert folder name here</i>
